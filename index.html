          <div class="sec7-div">
            I'm assuming you are comfortable with the basics of writing HTML &
            CSS.
          </div>
          <div class="sec7-div">
            I won't be looking at all the CSS involved, but really focusing
            specifically on the flexbox parts of it.
          </div>
          <h3 class="sec7-h3 w7">
            What if I have some experience with flexbox already?
          </h3>
          <div class="sec7-div">
            If you've started using flexbox but have trouble getting it to
            behave, or you feel like you aren't getting the most out of it, this
            course is for you!
          </div>

          <div class="sec7-div">
            We break it all down and then build up from there, so even if you're
            new to flexbox you should be able to follow, but there is a lot to
            gain even if you've already been using it, but you're looking to
            really take control of it and unlock it's full potential.
          </div>

          <h3 class="sec7-h3 b7">How much time will it take me to complete?</h3>
          <div class="sec7-div">
            Everyone is different, so it's hard to say for sure, but it'll take
            some time.
          </div>
          <div class="sec7-div">
            There are over 4.5 hours of content, plus challenges for you to
            complete along the way, and hopefully you are putting things into
            action throughout, so to get the most out of the course, I'd
            estimate at least 7 to 10 hours. Some might go faster, others
            longer.
          </div>

          <h3 class="sec7-h3 b7">Are the video lessons closed captioned?</h3>
          <div class="sec7-div">
            Yes, they have all been professionally closed captioned!

            Can I buy multiple licenses for my company? And do you offer a
            discount for bulk purchases?

            Yes, you sure can! Send me an email hi [at] kevinpowell.co and I'll
